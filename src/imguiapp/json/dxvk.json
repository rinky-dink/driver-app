Presentation improvements\r\nIf `VK_KHR_present_wait` is supported, and if vertical synchronization is enabled, frame latency events will now be signaled when an image is actually being presented, rather than when rendering work prior to the present request has completed on the GPU. This may reduce input latency in some games, also affects the `dxgi.maxFrameLatency` and `d3d9.maxFrameLatency` options.\r\n\r\nThis functionality is also used to more accurately report the number of frames actually presented via DXGI frame statistics.\r\n\r\n**Note:** On some platforms and compositors, Vulkan present events may not correspond to the image actually being presented on screen, in which case frame latency is going to remain higher than expected.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if `VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1` is supported, enabling and disabling vertical synchronization may no longe require recreating the Vulkan swap chain, which works around severe performance issues in games which change their present interval on a per-frame basis.\r\n\r\n**Note:** On Linux, this is currently only supported when running Gamescope with `ENABLE_GAMESCOPE_WSI=1` set.\r\n\r\n## Configuration changes\r\nThe `dxgi.nvapiHack` config option was deprecated, and a new option `dxgi.hideNvidiaGpu` with a slight change in behaviour was added instead, alongside similar options for AMD and Intel GPUs. This allows implementing more targeted application workarounds for issues with e.g. XESS libraries in the future if necessary. Refer to the [example configuration](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/blob/master/dxvk.conf) for more details.\r\n\r\n**Note:** The old `dxgi.nvapiHack` option still works if `dxgi.hideNvidiaGpu` is not set, but will be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `dxgi.tearFree` and `d3d9.tearFree` options were consolidated into a new `dxvk.tearFree` option, due to changes in the presentation logic. The old options were removed.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes and Improvements\r\n- Configuration options can now be specified via an environment variable, `DXVK_CONFIG`. See the README for details (PR #3581).\r\n- If `VK_EXT_depth_bias_control` is supported, depth bias scaling will now be correct in most situations. This fixes shadow rendering artifacts in various D3D9 games and is especially important on GPUs that do not support 24-bit depth formats. This affects games such as F.E.A.R. (#1461), Far Cry 2 (#2941) and Assassin's Creed Brotherhood (#2642).\r\n- If `VK_EXT_line_rasterization` and its relevant features are supported, smooth or rectangular lines will now be used if requested by the application. This functionality is generally not used by games, but may be useful for applications such as level editors.\r\n- If `VK_KHR_maintenance5` is supported, `DXGI_FORMAT_A8_UNORM` images will now use the corresponding Vulkan format.\r\n- D3D9 command submission now works the same way as it does for D3D11, which will lead to more submissions but generally reduces resource readback latency. This may improve performance in games that frequently synchronize with the GPU.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with D3D9 feedback loop tracking.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with D3D11 stream output (#3634).\r\n- Fixed a bug and performance issues with the implementation of D3D11 tiled resources.\r\n- Fixed various issues with reporting HDR metadata.\r\n- Fixed a crash when compiling D3D9 shaders generated by the vkd3d HLSL compiler. (PR #3616)\r\n- Implemented keyed mutex synchronization on top of newly added winevulkan functionality (PR #3601, PR #3635).\r\n**Note:** This will only work with recent Proton builds.\r\n- Added stubs for various D3D9On12 interop interfaces. This is needed for **Train Simulator Classic** (#3445).\r\n- Added an interface to allow external libraries, such as NVAPI, to enable HDR in various D3D11 games as well as Elden Ring (PR #3625).\r\n**Note:** This will only work in combination with https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/commit/c3a1c48eebdef1d0f9f030ebd57e2c40625dc542 or newer.

D3D11On12 support\r\nIn order to enable D3D12 support in recent Unity Engine titles such as **Lego Builder's Journey**, this release introduces support for creating D3D11 devices from a D3D12 device using [D3D11On12CreateDevice](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d11on12/nf-d3d11on12-d3d11on12createdevice), as well as the basic [ID3D11On12Device](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d11on12/nn-d3d11on12-id3d11on12device) interface. This is achieved by importing the Vulkan device and resource handles from vkd3d-proton into DXVK, and otherwise uses DXVK's existing D3D11 implementation.\r\n\r\nA `vkd3d-proton` build as of https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/commit/26c4fed09b14530a4cf1bbcca79a102a8908158a or later is required for this to work.\r\n\r\n## D3D9 Partial Presentation\r\nDXVK now supports presenting to parts of a window by copying the contents of the backbuffer to system memory and then drawing them into the window on the CPU. This improves compatibility with game launchers, particularly those based on Microsoft's WPF toolkit, and some visual novels. It will however come with a noticable performance hit.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, overall behaviour of D3D9 swap chains was improved and the `d3d9.noExplicitFrontBuffer` option was removed.\r\n\r\n## Logging changes\r\nWhen running on Proton or plain Wine, DXVK will no longer create log files by default and instead only write log messages to the console using wine-specific functionality, in order to avoid creating unnecessary extra files. This matches vkd3d-proton behaviour. Note that log file creation can be re-enabled by setting the environment variable `DXVK_LOG_PATH` to a valid path.\r\n\r\n**When filing bug reports, users are encouraged to upload the full Proton log.**\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes and Improvements\r\n- Warnings about unknown interfaces being queried via `QueryInterface` will only be logged once in order to avoid growing log files indefinitely in some games. (#3231)\r\n- Fixed a regression when rendering YUY2 or UYUY texture formats. This fixes in-game videos in **Jade Empire** (#3182) and **Sid Meier's Pirates** (#3189) (PR #3342)\r\n- Fixed an issue wherein threads were not properly destroyed.\r\n- Fixed Vulkan validation errors caused by incorrect layout tracking when enabling feedback loops for a texture.\r\n- Fixed Vulkan validation errors caused by 0x0 sized clears in D3D9.\r\n- D3D9 StateBlocks now only allocate memory for the parts that are actually used. This fixes **Total War: Shogun 2** running out of address space when using the D3D9 renderer.

HDR support\r\nOn systems supporting HDR10 color spaces, HDR can now be enabled by setting the environment variable `DXVK_HDR=1`, or by setting the  option `dxgi.enableHDR = True` in the [configuration file](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Configuration). When using [vkd3d-proton](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton) **2.8** or newer, this will allow D3D12 games to detect and use the HDR10 color space if they support it.\r\n\r\n**No major Linux desktop environment currently supports HDR.** In order to use this on Linux, a [Gamescope](https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope) session with `--hdr-enabled` is required. This is currently only supported under AMDGPU and requires kernel patches from the [josh-hdr-colorimetry](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/JoshuaAshton/linux-hdr/-/commits/josh-hdr-colorimetry) branch.\r\n\r\n**Note:** D3D11 support is implemented, but not expected to work in most games as they typically require AMDAGS or NVAPI to set up HDR output, rather than using the corresponding DXGI APIs. Additionally, only Nvidia drivers are expected to work on Windows.\r\n\r\n## Shader compilation improvements\r\nUse of pipeline libraries was extended to pipelines with tessellation or geometry shaders in order to further reduce stutter. Additionally, more features of the `VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3` extension are leveraged to reduce stutter in some situations when MSAA is used, provided that the Vulkan driver supports them.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Current development builds of RADV will expose `VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library` with the features that DXVK needs if the `RADV_PERFTEST=gpl` environment variable is set. Note that the implementation is not yet complete and does not support shader caching at this time, but it should generally work with DXVK.\r\n\r\n## Sample rate shading\r\nFor older games that support MSAA, the `d3d9.forceSampleRateShading` and `d3d11.forceSampleRateShading` options were added to let users enable sample rate shading for all shaders. This will have a **very** high impact on GPU-bound performance, but may increase overall image quality in certain games that suffer from specular aliasing or shimmering alpha-tested geometry.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Games that resolve the rendered images inadequately (e.g. performing a linear resolve on HDR render targets) will likely not benefit from this option.\r\n\r\n## GLFW backend\r\nFor native Linux builds of DXVK, a GLFW backend was added as a compile-time alternative to the existing SDL2 backend. See PR #3111 for details.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes and Improvements\r\n- Improved D3D11 command submission logic in order to make overall performance more consistent, and to bring DXVK's behaviour more in line with native D3D11 drivers.\r\n- Fixed D3D11 reference counting issues around 2D textures. (#3169)\r\n- Fixed Vulkan validation errors when creating `DXGI_FORMAT_A8_UNORM` UAVs. Note that UAVs of this format may not work as expected.\r\n- Fixed Vulkan validation errors that would occur when allocating dedicated image memory on Nvidia GPUs in some situations.\r\n- Fixed Vulkan validation errors caused by broken timeline semaphores on 32-bit Proton.\r\n- Worked around an issue with the Uplay overlay being stuck on screen. (#3146)\r\nNote that this fix does not apply to Windows as it was achieved by loading `winevulkan.dll` directly instead of the actual Vulkan loader.\r\n**Note that this change will break Red Dead Redemption 2 with dxvk-nvapi prior to this commit: https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/commit/ac00a42fb6355d6e940b520341b670097c586438**\r\n- Worked around a bug in AMD's Windows driver as well as AMDVLK that would cause numerous games to crash since DXVK 2.0. (#3172)\r\n- Fewer threads will be used to perform background optimization of graphics pipeines. This may result in a smoother gameplay experience on some systems. Note that this change does not affect initial shader compiling, as finishing that quickly is crucial to avoid stutter.\r\n- The state cache file will now only be created when the first pipeline is written to it, in order to avoid empty cache files.\r\nThis change mostly affects D3D9 games on systems with `EXT_graphics_pipeline_library` support.\r\n- **Ashes of the Singularity**: Fixed performance regression caused by suboptimal descriptor set allocation.\r\n- **Battlefield: Bad Company 2**: Fixed flickering (#3078, PR #3079)\r\n- **Cardfight!! Vanguard**: Fixed rendering (PR #3068).\r\n- **Gujian 3**: Fixed rendering issues on some GPUs. (#1784)\r\n- **Resident Evil 4 HD**: Fixed invalid Vulkan usage causing a GPU hang on RADV. (PR #3089)\r\n- **Saints Row: The Third**: Fixed a severe performance issue with rain when using the D3D9 renderer. (#2473, PR #3158)\r\n- **Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice**: Fixed stuttering issues on Nvidia GPUs. (#3179)\r\n- **Sonic Frontiers**: Worked around a game bug that would cause shadows to flicker when GPU-bound.\r\n- **Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance**: Fixed a crash after loading (#3058, PR #3060)\r\n\r\n**Note:** The setup script `setup_dxvk.sh` was no longer deemed useful and got removed. This change will only affect users who manually install DXVK into a wine prefix, rather than using it through Proton or Lutris.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Due to changes to our DXGI implementation, older versions of [vkd3d-proton](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton) (prior to **2.8**) will no longer work with this version of DXVK.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/88251000/reactions","total_count":248,"+1":100,"-1":0,"laugh":11,"hooray":58,"confused":0,"heart":65,"rocket":8,"eyes":6}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/72018053","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/72018053/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/72018053/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.0","id":72018053,"author":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBln0aM4ESuiF","tag_name":"v2.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version

Driver compatibility\r\nA **Vulkan 1.3 capable driver** and wine version are **required** to run this version of DXVK. See the [driver support](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Driver-support) page for details.\r\n\r\nMany features in this release, especially the shader compilation changes detailed below, require the use of modern Vulkan features, such as Dynamic Rendering, Extended Dynamic State, and Null Descriptors. Due to the significant changes required to make use of them, it was no longer practical to maintain and test code paths for older drivers which do not support these features.\r\n\r\nIn practice, any system capable of running D3D11 and D3D12 games using **Proton Experimental** right now will be able to run DXVK 2.0.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Third-party Vulkan layers that were not updated for Vulkan 1.3 will no longer work.\r\n\r\n## D3D9 changes\r\n\r\n### Memory management improvements\r\nIn order to reduce the likelihood of running out of address space in 32-bit D3D9 games, DXVK will now use memory-mapped files to store shadow copies of textures. This allows us to unmap memory that is not being used by the game, thus freeing up significant amounts of address space, up to several hundred Megabytes. See PR #2663 for implementation details.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This change does not affect 64-bit games since address space is not a concern there. It also does not affect D3D10 or D3D11 since resource uploads work differently in those APIs and are much more memory efficient.\r\n\r\n### Render target feedback loops\r\nOn drivers which support `VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout`, reading from an active render target in D3D9 games is now properly supported, which previously caused rendering artifacts on newer AMD hardware and required driver-level workarounds. This affects a number of games, including **GTA IV**.\r\n\r\n### Alpha test improvements\r\nThe D3D9 alpha test implementation was changed to more closely match the behaviour of Nvidia's implementation, which fixes inaccuracies in various games. The `d3d9.alphaTestWiggleRoom` option was removed, and games that previously required this option should now work correctly by default.\r\n\r\n## D3D10 changes\r\nDXVK previously shipped incomplete implementations of `d3d10.dll` and `d3d10_1.dll`, but has not installed them by default since [Version 1.6](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.6) since wine's implementation provides more features that are needed for D3D10 games to run, including the D3D10 Effects framework.\r\n\r\nSince our implementation is incomplete and has not been used by Proton or Lutris for a very long time, DXVK will no longer ship these DLLs starting with this release. The D3D10 API itself is still supported via `d3d10core.dll`.\r\n\r\n## D3D11 changes\r\n### Feature support\r\nDXVK now exposes D3D11 Feature Level **12_1** with the following newly added features:\r\n- Tiled Resources up to **Tier 3**, provided that the corresponding Vulkan sparse binding and sparse residency features are supported\r\n- Conservative Rasterization up to **Tier 3**, provided that the corresponding Vulkan conservative rasterization features are supported.\r\n- Rasterizer Ordered Views, provided that the corresponding Vulkan fragment shader interlock features are supported.\r\n\r\nWhile no games are known to use these features directly in D3D11, some games and game launchers rely on feature support being consistent between D3D11 and D3D12 in order to allow users to enable D3D12 in the game options. While our implementation of these feature is generally functional, there may be bugs or performance issues in case a game does use them.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, DXVK now supports the `D3D11_FEATURE_SHADER_CACHE` and `D3D11_FEATURE_D3D11_OPTIONS5` feature queries.\r\n\r\n**Note:** AMD Vulkan drivers do currently not support fragment shader interlock and are limited to feature level **12_0**.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Intel's ANV driver currently does not support the corresponding Vulkan features and is therefore limited to feature level **11_1**. This applies to both DXVK and vkd3d-proton.\r\n\r\n### Device contexts\r\nThe implementations of `ID3D11DeviceContext` were refactored so that immediate contexts and deferred contexts no longer use common entry points. This is closer to Windows behaviour and may improve compatibility to third-party libraries and mods that hook into the D3D11 immediate context specifically, and reduces CPU overhead since some frequently used code paths are now more specialized for each context type.\r\n\r\nState clear and restore methods were optimized to further reduce CPU overhead in games that heavily use deferred contexts, e.g. **Assassin's Creed: Origins**, or explicitly call `ClearState` frequently, e.g. **God of War**.\r\n\r\n## Shader compilation changes\r\nOn drivers which support `VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library`, including the `IndependentInterpolationDecoration` feature, Vulkan shaders will now be compiled at the time the game loads its D3D shaders, rather than at draw time. This reduces or eliminates shader compile stutter in many games.\r\n\r\nIn games that load their shaders during loading screens or in the menu, this can lead to prolonged periods of very high CPU utilization, especially on weaker CPUs. For affected games it is recommended to wait for shader compilation to finish before starting the game to avoid stutter and low performance. Shader compiler activity can be monitored with `DXVK_HUD=compiler`.\r\n\r\n**Note:** The relevant Vulkan features are currently only supported by Nvidia drivers (version **520.56.06** or later). Driver support is expected to improve in the future.\r\n\r\n### State cache interactions\r\n\r\nThis feature largely replaces the state cache. If the given Vulkan features are supported, only pipelines that cannot use the pipeline library feature (e.g. pipelines using tessellation shaders) will be written to and read from the state cache, so newly created state cache files will typically only contain a few dozen to a few hundred pipelines, as opposed to thousands or tens of thousands. If the graphics pipeline library feature is not supported, the state cache will be used the same way as it was in older DXVK versions.\r\n\r\n**Note:** State cache files created with DXVK versions prior to **1.4.3** can no longer be used.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Despite our efforts, due to the significant changes under the hood, there may be issues when using an older state cache file under some circumstances. If you experience crashes, please test if the game runs with a clean cache file (`DXVK_STATE_CACHE=reset`) before reporting a bug.\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\n- Games which only load their D3D shaders at draw time (e.g. Witcher 3, most Unreal Engine games) will still exhibit some stutter, although it should still be less severe than without this feature.\r\n- For 32-bit games, the implementation tries to aggressively free Vulkan pipelines in order to save memory. This may cause stutter if the driver's on-disk shader cache is not working properly.\r\n- On Nvidia drivers, the on-disk shader cache will be significantly larger than with previous versions of DXVK. It may be necessary to bypass the size limit by setting the environment variable `__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_SKIP_CLEANUP=1`, or setting a new limit manually via `__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_SIZE` (in bytes).\r\n\r\n## Linux build support\r\nWork from [dxvk-native](https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxvk-native) has been upstreamed in order to facilitate native Linux builds of DXVK, which can be used as a drop-in replacement to port  D3D applications without having to change rendering code.\r\n\r\n**Note:** When porting a D3D11 application, please refer to the [Feature support](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Feature-support) and [Developer Guidelines](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Developer-guidelines) pages on the Wiki to avoid hitting unsupported or slow code paths in DXVK.\r\n\r\n## Repository changes\r\nAs part of cleaning up the repository, test applications that were of limited usefulness, as well as our custom d3dcompiler frontends, have been moved to the new [dxvk-tests](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk-tests) repository.\r\n\r\nVulkan and SPIR-V headers are now pulled in as submodules from the original repositories. This changes how the repository needs to be cloned and updated, or otherwise building DXVK will fail:\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk.git\r\n\r\n# Run the following command to make git pull\r\n# automatically pull in submodule updates\r\ncd dxvk\r\ngit config submodule.recurse true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe [project wiki](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki) was also updated and expanded to be more useful.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes and Improvements\r\n- Improved behaviour of DXGI waitable swap chains.\r\n- Improved implementation of DXGI frame statistics.\r\n**Note:** The implementation is still not accurate, especially in scenarios with multiple displays or if variable refresh rate is used.\r\n- Removed limitations on how many resources can be bound at the same time.\r\n- Removed several workarounds for specific Vulkan drivers or driver versions. This is primarily relevant for Steam's shader pre-caching, as the generated shader code no longer diverges as much depending on the driver version and supported feature set.\r\n- D3D11 shaders now use the Vulkan memory model in order to more accurately implement UAV coherency rules in compute shaders.\r\n- Fixed various issuses with the D3D11.3 `WriteToSubresource` and `ReadFromSubresource` methods.\r\n- Fixed various float emulation issues in D3D9 applications.\r\n- Fixed seamless cube map filtering in D3D9 applications (PR #2889).\r\n- Fixed issues when rendering to `DXGI_FORMAT_A8_UNORM` (D3D11) or `D3DFMT_A8` (D3D9) render targets with blending enabled.\r\n- Fixed a bug with dual-source blending when multiple render targets are bound, which could lead to unpredictable results. This affects **Elex 2** and potentially other games.\r\n- Fixed memory allocation logic on Intel integrated graphics.\r\n- Changed behaviour of the `DXVK_STATE_CACHE` environment variable, see the `README` for details.\r\n- Changed the `DXVK_PERF_EVENTS` environment variable to `DXVK_DEBUG`, see the `README` for details.\r\n- **Alan Wake**: Fixed a regression that caused grey rectangles to appear on screen on AMD GPUs.

Features\r\nImplemented initial support for shared resources (PR #2516). This fixes video playback in a number of Koei Tecmo games (Atelier series, Nioh 2), as well as the D3D11-based UI in the Windows version of Black Mesa. The required wine patches are currently only available in **Proton Experimental**. This feature **will not be supported** on Windows systems.\r\n\r\nThis feature is still experimental and has not been thoroughly tested on all graphics drivers, so issues are to be expected. Currently, only basic 2D texture sharing between D3D9 and D3D11 is supported when using DXVK for both APIs. API features that are currently not supported include:\r\n- `IDXGIKeyedMutex`. Documentation is very poor and it's not clear how an implementation is supposed to behave.\r\n- Resource sharing with D3D12 applications under **vkd3d-proton**. This may be added in the future.\r\n- Resource sharing with Vulkan applications.\r\n\r\n*Note: The Black Mesa UI flickers heavily when the game is not GPU-bound. This also happens on Windows to some degree and is a game bug.*\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes and Improvements\r\n- Added an environment variable `DXVK_ENABLE_NVAPI` to bypass the vendor ID override. Setting it to `1` behaves exactly the same as setting `dxvk.nvapiHack = False` in the config file, but may allow for better integration into Lutris or the Proton launch script. (#2544)\r\n- Improved shader code generation when local arrays are used. This may improve performance on Nvidia drivers in some D3D11 games.\r\n- Fixed shader code generation when switch-case fallthrough is used in Shader Model 4.0 (#2556). Current FXC versions no longer generate such code.\r\n- Potentially improved performance when rendering to `DXGI_FORMAT_R11G11B10_FLOAT` images that can also be used with unordered access views.\r\n- Fixed various D3D9 issues related to texture uploads (#2559, #2541, #2535).\r\n- **Assassin's Creed 3**, **Black Flag**: Enabled `d3d11.cachedDynamicResources = a` to work around severe performance issues.\r\n- **Frostpunk**: Enabled `d3d11.cachedDynamicResources = c` to work around low CPU-bound performance.\r\n- **God of War**: Fixed some issues that started with game patch 1.0.9:\r\n  - Extremely inconsistent frame pacing when the game detects an AMD GPU, `dxgi.maxFrameLatency = 1` is now set by default to work around this issue.\r\n  - Heavy flickering of some lights. Apparently this was also fixed in the game in patch 1.0.11.\r\n- **GTA: San Andreas**: Fixed UI rendering issues (#2560)\r\n- **Rayman Origins**: Fixed rendering issues (#2545)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/62827654/reactions","total_count":166,"+1":53,"-1":0,"laugh":6,"hooray":32,"confused":0,"heart":51,"rocket":21,"eyes":3}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/61005592","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/61005592/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/61005592/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.10","id":61005592,"author":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBln0aM4Dot8Y","tag_name":"v1.10","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version 1.10","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2022-03-04T16:16:01Z","published_at":"2022-03-04T16:32:56Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/assets/58566599","id":58566599,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBln0aM4DfafH","name":"dxvk-1.10.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":8271267,"download_count":73152,"created_at":"2022-03-04T16:26:45Z","updated_at":"2022-03-04T16:26:58Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/download/v1.10/dxvk-1.10.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/tarball/v1.10","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/zipball/v1.10","body":"## Performance improvements\r\n- Reduced unnecessary worker thread synchronization around resource readbacks for both D3D11 and D3D9. This can significantly increase CPU-bound performance in games like **Assassin's Creed: Origins** and other titles built on the same engine, with smaller improvements seen in **Elex II**, **God of War**, **GTA IV** and others.\r\n- When using [D3D11_MAP_WRITE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d11/ne-d3d11-d3d11_map) on a staging resource that's currently being read by the GPU, DXVK will now attempt to create a copy of that resource in order to avoid GPU synchronization. This improves performance in **Quantum Break** and potentially other games. This behaviour can be tweaked using the `d3d11.maxImplicitDiscardSize` option.\r\n- Optimized [UpdateSubresource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d11/nf-d3d11-id3d11devicecontext-updatesubresource) for small constant buffer updates. This further improves performance in **God of War** and potentially other games.\r\n- Improved the way resource uploads and staging buffers are handled in D3D11. This may reduce memory usage and CPU overhead in some games.\r\n- Added more information to the HUD that can be useful for troubleshooting performance issues: GPU synchronizations per frame, worker thread synchronizations per frame, and pipeline barrier count.\r\n- GPU synchronization, when necessary, no longer uses busy-waiting, which may reduce power consumption on portable devices in some games.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes and Improvements\r\n- Added a `D3D11On12CreateDevice` stub so applications using this don't immediately crash (PR #2485).\r\n**Note** that supporting D3D11on12 is currently not viable.\r\n- Version numbers for Intel's Windows driver should now be reported properly.\r\n**Note** that using DXVK on this driver is highly discouraged and will likely not work.\r\n- **ArmA 2**: Fixed texture-related issues (PR #2477).\r\n- **Black Mesa**: Fixed lighting issues.\r\n- **Resident Evil 0**, **5**, **6**, **Resident Evil: Revelations 2**: Improved performance (PR #2466).\r\n- **Total War: Warhammer III**: Significantly improved GPU-bound performance on setups with a dedicated GPU.\r\n\r\n## Per-game workarounds\r\nReplaced the previous `d3d11.apitraceMode` option with  `d3d11.cachedDynamicResources`, which provides a more granular way to specify resource types to allocate in cached system memory. Refer to the example `dxvk.conf` for details. This change was not made for the equivalent D3D9 option yet.\r\n\r\nNormally, [D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d11/ne-d3d11-d3d11_usage) resources are expected to be write-only from the CPU and read-only from the GPU, but despite this, some games perform CPU-side reads on the mapped memory, which can cause severe performance degradation since those reads would have to go over PCI-E, or at least uncached write-combined memory. This is especially problematic on systems with Resizeable BAR and can cause issues even on Windows D3D11 drivers.\r\n\r\nGames that will use this option by default include **Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition** (#2491), **Anno 1800**, **Final Fantasy XIV**, **Nier Replicant**, **The Evil Within** (PR #2522), and all games that previously had `d3d11.apitraceMode` enabled by default.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/61005592/reactions","total_count":153,"+1":40,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":25,"confused":0,"heart":43,"rocket":31,"eyes":13}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/57839641","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/57839641/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/57839641/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.9.4","id":57839641,"author":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBln0aM4DcpAZ","tag_name":"v1.9.4","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version 1.9.4","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2022-01-24T14:09:02Z","published_at":"2022-01-24T15:15:55Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/assets/54820036","id":54820036,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBln0aM4DRHzE","name":"dxvk-1.9.4.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":8242967,"download_count":152692,"created_at":"2022-01-24T15:13:13Z","updated_at":"2022-01-24T15:15:29Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/download/v1.9.4/dxvk-1.9.4.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/tarball/v1.9.4","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/zipball/v1.9.4","body":"This is a small maintenance release in preparation for upcoming Proton versions.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes and Improvements\r\n- Fixed an issue that would cause VRAM to not be utilized on RBAR-enabled Nvidia GPUs if the `dxvk.shrinkNvidiaHvvHeap` option is enabled (#2438).\r\n- Enabled strict D3D9 float emulation by default on future versions of RADV.

This is needed for videos in **Nier Replicant** to play back (#2048), and may also be required for **Contra: Rogue Corps** (#1676). Note that Nier videos currently do not work with Proton for other reasons.\r\n- Implemented Conservative Rasterization for supported GPUs, which allows enabling the Nvidia ShadowLibs option in **Final Fantasy XV** and possibly similar options in other games.\r\n- Reduced presentation latency by up to one frame under some circumstances. This may help with games that are limited by vertical synchronization, DXGI frame latency settings, or external frame limiters that operate on `vkAcquireNextImageKHR` (PR #2075).\r\n- Added a frame rate limiter. This is mostly intended as a workaround for games that do not work correctly at high frame rates, but can also be controlled with an environment variable. Check the README for detais.\r\n\r\n## Device selection\r\nSoftware-only Vulkan implementations such as Lavapipe are no longer reported to the application as long as there is a Vulkan-capable GPU present on the system. This should fix issues where games try using Lavapipe over a proper driver on some setups with recent Mesa versions and then crash due to hitting an unsupported texture format.\r\n\r\nLavapipe can now be used with DXVK by manually setting the `VK_ICD_FILENAMES` environment variable. While some of DXVK's feature requirements have been lifted in order to allow it to run, note that limitations of this driver may still cause some games to crash or render incorrectly, while others (such as The Witcher 3) were tested successfully.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes and Improvements\r\n- Improved texture and buffer uploads in D3D9.\r\n- Fixed the Origin overlay not showing up when using DXVK's DXGI implementation (#1996).\r\n- Disabled Wine Gecko/Mono installers showing up when using install script.\r\n- Disabled a workaround to reduce the amount of random crashes on Nvidia drivers since the underlying driver issue was fixed in the 465.xx releases (#1963), which may improve performance in some games.\r\n- Fixed precision issues in shaders that do not have the `refactoringAllowed` flag set.\r\n- Fixed some potential issues around image clears that could lead to artifacting or broken rendering.\r\n- Fixed an issue where games with upper-case file extensions may create duplicate logs or cache files (#2079).\r\n- Fixed monitor layout issues when restoring display modes on multi-monitor setup (#2064).\r\n- Fixed a bug in D3D9 where child windows did not have their positions converted relative to their parents (#1958).\r\n- Removed workarounds specific to RADV with the LLVM shader compiler. Please use the ACO backend instead (default since Mesa 20.2).\r\n- Further reduced the size of state cache files. State caches from previous DXVK versions will be converted automatically.\r\n- Debugging symbols now work in GDB with wine-reload (4kb file alignment)\r\n- Misc. vector/matrix math fixes and optimizations in D3D9.\r\n- **Atelier Mysterious Trilogy Deluxe Pack**, **Dal Segno** and **Nights of Azure**: Added the usual white screen workaround (#2035, #2022, #2044).\r\n- **Days Gone**: Implemented missing DXGI frame statistics functions in order to fix very low frame rates (#2065).\r\n- **Demon Stone**: Work around the game breaking at >60fps (#2103).\r\n- **Dragon Quest Builder 2**: Fixed an issue where the game would immediately run out of system memory (PR #1995).\r\n- **Final Fantasy XIII**, **Spec Ops: The Line**: Fixed a bug with some postprocessing effects on NVIDIA.\r\n- **GTA IV re-release**: Work around incorrect VRAM amounts being shown when nvapi and atidlxx libraries are not present as it assumes all GPUs to be Intel IGPs with unified memory in that case.\r\n- **Halo 2**: Fixed fog rendering issues (#2059).\r\n- **Kohan II**: Fixed out-of-memory crash on startup (#2030).\r\n- **Nier Replicant**: Enabled 60 FPS limit to work around issues with the game running too fast, and enforced full-rate vertical synchronization in order to work around related issues with the game sometimes being stuck at weird frame rates.\r\nNote that AMD RX 5000 and 6000 series GPUs may need to be put into high performance mode manually in order to fix performance issues caused by aggressive power management.\r\n- **Second Sight**: Fixed missing UI (#2056).\r\n- **TrackMania Forever**: Fixed rendering issues introduced in DXVK 1.8.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/44656340/reactions","total_count":225,"+1":98,"-1":0,"laugh":15,"hooray":22,"confused":0,"heart":45,"rocket":35,"eyes":10}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/39062183","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/39062183/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/39062183/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.8.1","id":39062183,"author":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM5MDYyMTgz","tag_name":"v1.8.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version

Refer to the [pull request](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/1275) for details and planned future work, and beware of frogs.\r\n\r\nFor future bug reports, please clarify which API is used by the game in question. \r\n\r\n### Bug fixes on top of D9VK 0.40.1\r\n- Fixed some memory and resource leaks in state blocks, deletion and device resetting\r\n- **Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition:** Fixed a black screen issue that occured on some drivers\r\n\r\n## HUD improvements\r\n- Improved overall appearance of the HUD and fixed an issue with some glyphs being placed incorrectly.\r\n- Memory allocation statistics now show the amount of memory allocated per Vulkan memory heap, which allows distinguishing between video memory and system memory allocations.\r\n- Fixed an issue where the draw call and queue submission statistics would be updated before the current frame has finished processing, leading to inaccurate numbers.\r\n- Draw call and queue submission statistics are now updated every 0.5 seconds to make them more readable.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes and Improvements\r\n- **Atelier Ryza**: Enabled workaround for a black screen issue caused by the game's D3D9 usage when trying to play back intro videos. Requires both D3D9 and D3D11.\r\n- **Crysis 3**: All GPUs are now reported as Nvidia GPUs by default. This enables the game to use a fast path with considerably lower CPU overhead, but may cause a small performance hit on certain Nvidia GPUs in GPU-bound scenarios. Note that it might be necessary to disable the loading of `nvapi.dll` in your wine prefix when using wine-staging.\r\n- **Fifa 19**: Fixed crash caused by a missing DXGI function (#1268).\r\n- **Halo MCC**: Reduced the number of log messages being generated due to invalid D3D11 API usage.\r\n- **Star Citizen**: Fixed a regression introduced in DXVK 1.4.3 causing lighting issues (#1262)."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/21933675","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/21933675/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/21933675/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.4.6","id":21933675,"author":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTIxOTMzNjc1","tag_name":"v1.4.6","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version 1.4.6","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2019-12-03T13:52:35Z","published_at":"2019-12-03T15:57:49Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/assets/16586486","id":16586486,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDE2NTg2NDg2","name":"dxvk-1.4.6.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":5735486,"download_count":33165,"created_at":"2019-12-04T11:46:51Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T11:47:00Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/download/v1.4.6/dxvk-1.4.6.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/tarball/v1.4.6","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/zipball/v1.4.6","body":"**Update:** Builds updated with 1ae7d4b30283d2eb06b467c581aafdbbd9d36cdf to work around potential game crashes when the state cache is enabled, see #1266.
