release rolls up a bunch of features, perf improvements and bug fixes / workarounds as usual.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n#### DXR enabled by default\r\n\r\n`VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr` is default now, and no longer needed.\r\nThere are some special cases where DXR is not enabled by default. The only such current example is\r\n\"Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice\" on Deck which force-enables DXR if it is supported, even on Deck.\r\nNew semantics are:\r\n\r\n- `dxr`: Force-enable DXR, even when it is considered unsafe\r\n- `nodxr`: Disable DXR\r\n- `dxr11`: Removed. `dxr` already implied DXR 1.1 anyway\r\n\r\n#### Sampler feedback\r\n\r\nThis feature was the last feature required for FL 12.2 and is implemented through emulation.\r\nAs demonstrated in the [implementation docs](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/blob/master/docs/sampler_feedback.md), all\r\nnative implementations of this feature are fundamentally broken in some way.\r\nThere's also no known game that ships requiring this feature, so we just consider this a checkbox feature.\r\n\r\n#### DX Ultimate (FL 12.2) now exposed by default\r\n\r\nOn RDNA2+ and Turing+ we can finally expose the DX Ultimate feature set!\r\n\r\n#### Misc\r\n\r\n- Implement a bunch of missing \"Vulkan-on-D3D12\" features\r\n  - IndependentFrontAndBackStencilRefMaskSupported\r\n  - TriangleFanSupported\r\n  - DynamicIndexBufferStripCutSupported\r\n  - DynamicDepthBiasSupported\r\n  - NonNormalizedCoordinateSamplersSupported\r\n  - MismatchingOutputDimensionsSupported\r\n  - PointSamplingAddressesNeverRoundUp\r\n  - RasterizerDesc2Supported\r\n    - Explicit line rasterization mode\r\n  - NarrowQuadrilateralLinesSupported\r\n  - AnisoFilterWithPointMipSupported\r\n- Implement missing MSAD instruction in DXIL, allowing FSR3 to run\r\n- Implement some esoteric DXR features\r\n  - Implement support for multiple mismatching global root signatures in DXR\r\n    - Fixes crash in Battlefield V\r\n  - Implement support for LOCAL_ON_EXTERNAL dependencies in DXR\r\n    - Fixes DXR in Warhammer: Darktide\r\n- Implement support for ExecuteIndirect + Mesh shaders with state changes\r\n  - Currently unused by games\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\n- Improve performance of NV_device_generated_commands and NV_device_generated_commands_compute by\r\n  reordering and batching command preprocessing\r\n  - We have observed 15% FPS gains in Halo Infinite on RADV\r\n  - 1-2% in Starfield in some test locations\r\n  - Needs pending Mesa work to land to take advantage of this improvement\r\n- Tune memory allocation patterns for DGC preprocess buffers\r\n  - Avoids a lot of allocation churn\r\n  - Greatly reduces CPU overhead on NV\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\n- Work around RADV bug causing GPU hang in RE4: Separate Ways DLC\r\n- Work around RADV bug causing GPU hang in Lords of the Fallen\r\n- Work around Witcher 3 bug causing broken shadows and GPU hangs when enabling DXR\r\n- Work around Cyberpunk 2077 bug when RT is enabled, where game would cause spurious GPU hangs due to accessing descriptor heap out of bounds\r\n- Work around Windjammers 2 bug causing random crashes on startup\r\n- Add support for VK_EXT_image_compression_control to allow for more fine-grained workarounds for broken games running on RADV\r\n- Enable NV_device_generated_commands_compute on latest NV beta drivers\r\n  - 545.x drivers are still disabled until a fix can be confirmed on shipping drivers\r\n- Remove CURB_MEMORY_PSO_CACHE workaround on Mesa 23.2+\r\n  - Should reduce overhead in PSO creation\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Misc dxil-spirv changes to fix various bugs in game shaders as usual\r\n- Fix Jurassic World Evolution 2 crashing when enabling DXR\r\n- Fix some deprecation warnings in Meson build system\r\n  - Some submodule locations moved, which may cause minor disruption\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/131382099/reactions","total_count":85,"+1":29,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":21,"confused":0,"heart":22,"rocket":10,"eyes":3}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/120647707","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/120647707/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/120647707/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.10","id":120647707,"author":{"login":"HansKristian-Work","id":17786731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg2NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17786731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODH0hx84HMPAb","tag_name":"v2.10","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version 2.10","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2023-09-08T14:07:40Z","published_at":"2023-09-11T13:53:35Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/assets/125529228","id":125529228,"node_id":"RA_kwDODH0hx84He2yM","name":"vkd3d-proton-2.10.tar.zst","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"HansKristian-Work","id":17786731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg2NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17786731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zstd","state":"uploaded","size":2568954,"download_count":16152,"created_at":"2023-09-11T13:52:49Z","updated_at":"2023-09-11T13:52:51Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/download/v2.10/vkd3d-proton-2.10.tar.zst"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/tarball/v2.10","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/zipball/v2.10","body":"This release rolls up a ton of bug fixes, game and driver workarounds, and other improvements.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n#### DirectStorage MetaCommands\r\n\r\nWe can now make use of `NV_memory_decompression` to implement\r\nGPU accelerated GDeflate compression in DirectStorage.\r\nThis is demonstrated to work in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart.\r\n\r\nWe also worked around an NV driver bug when using the fallback GDeflate shader.\r\nThe fallback works on RADV.\r\n\r\n#### Enhanced Barriers\r\n\r\nNOTE: This isn't all that well tested because there are no games shipping with this yet to our knowledge.\r\n\r\n#### Device generated commands for compute\r\n\r\nWith `NV_device_generated_commands_compute` we can efficiently implement\r\nStarfield's use of ExecuteIndirect which hammers multi-dispatch COMPUTE + root parameter changes.\r\nPreviously, we would rely on a very slow workaround.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This feature is currently only enabled on RADV due to driver issues.\r\n\r\n#### Misc\r\n\r\n- Support Root Signature version 1.2\r\n- Implement Shader Model 6.7\r\n  -

It is possible that various scripts must be updated\r\nto accomodate both DLLs now. Once d3d12.dll is installed in a prefix,\r\nonly d3d12core.dll needs to be updated, as d3d12.dll is just a trivial shim either way.\r\n\r\n### Performance improvements\r\n\r\n- Greatly reduce system memory requirements on the first run of an application.\r\n  SPIR-V code was held in memory \"just in case\" it had to be recompiled later, but this is no longer the case.\r\n- Use `VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_libraries` to avoid shader compilation stutter in some extreme edge cases.\r\n- Improve performance with certain bad occlusion query patterns in e.g. Elden Ring.\r\n- Improve CPU performance of `VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer` even further with vendor-specific \"ultra-fast\" paths.\r\n  - Our microbenchmark for single descriptor copies are now significantly faster than native D3D12 drivers on both RADV and NVIDIA.\r\n  - Intel performance numbers are TBD, but we expect a win there as well.\r\n- Improve VRAM oversubscription behavior when\r\n  `VK_EXT_pageable_device_local_memory` is supported. (NVIDIA contribution, thanks!)\r\n  This allows us to implement `Evict` and `MakeResident` APIs in a useful way.\r\n  `VK_EXT_memory_priority` is also used for static priorities as a fallback.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n- Add `VK_EXT_image_sliced_view_of_3d` to support sliced 3D UAVs.\r\n- Improve DXR 1.1 support with `VK_EXT_pipeline_library_group_handles`.\r\n- Implement `VK_EXT_fragment_shader_interlock`. Completes FL 12.1.\r\n- Move to Vulkan 1.3 as minimum version.\r\n- D3D11on12 interoperability interfaces are now supported.\r\n  It is compatible with DXVK 2.2, which actually implements 11on12.\r\n\r\n### Legacy swapchain removal\r\n\r\nThe old swapchain implementation is now gone.\r\nDXVK 2.1 is required as we now share common code.\r\nThis means that there is no fallback for pre-2.1 DXVK versions or Wine DXGI anymore.\r\n\r\n#### Native Linux swapchain support\r\n\r\nThe new swapchain can support Linux native surfaces.\r\nThe demo applications in `demos/` with functional swapchain now builds on Linux as well.\r\n\r\n### Driver workarounds\r\n\r\n- `KHR_present_wait` is currently disabled on NVIDIA drivers due to a bug that would occur on some PRIME setups.\r\n  This is supposed to be fixed in the latest beta drivers, and this workaround will eventually be removed\r\n  when we have a confirmed major version that fixes the issue.\r\n- Workaround RADV bug causing memory bloat in shader caches. Can save several 100s of MBs of memory,\r\n  which is important on certain memory hungry titles to avoid instability.\r\n- Workaround NVIDIA bug with concurrent queue submissions using timeline semaphores.\r\n  Fixed a bunch of inexplicable `Xid 109 CTX_SWITCH_TIMEOUT` errors in many different games.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes and game workarounds\r\n\r\nVarious bugfixes for games as usual. Listing individual games is becoming impractical at this point,\r\nand it's best to refer to other sources for compatibility information with specific games.\r\nAs usual, a bunch of fixes in dxil-spirv to fix shader bugs.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- On Wine, use `winevulkan.dll` rather than `vulkan-1.dll` if available.\r\n  Works around some games that hook Vulkan despite using D3D12.\r\n- Improve compatibility with games relying on certain AgilitySDK details.\r\n- Improve build system compatibility with different `widl` versions.\r\n- `VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr` now enables DXR 1.1 as well. `dxr11` is kept for compat.\r\n- Fix HDR Metadata MinLuminance value.\r\n- Add `VKD3D_LIMIT_TESS_FACTORS` to work around excessive tessellation. Enabled for Wo Long.\r\n- (Developers) Improve debugging support with more detailed breadcrumb information.\r\n- (Developers) Insert more actionable information in captures and logs.\r\n- (Developers) Log directly to Wine when available. Makes `PROTON_LOG=1` more reliable.\r\n- (Developers) Set thread names on Win32 build as well.\r\n- (Developers) Use native Linux calling convention instead of `ms_abi`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/103637743/reactions","total_count":49,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":25,"confused":0,"heart":13,"rocket":8,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/86209974","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/86209974/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/86209974/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.8","id":86209974,"author":{"login":"HansKristian-Work","id":17786731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg2NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17786731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODH0hx84FI3W2","tag_name":"v2.8","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version

release rolls up some significant new developments before the holidays.\r\n\r\n## VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer support\r\n\r\nThis extension is significant in that it removes a ton of CPU overhead.\r\nWe already had most of this in place on RADV and Steam Deck,\r\nbut this will allow NVIDIA, Intel, Turnip, and other AMD driver implementations to hit the same optimal code paths.\r\nGPU bound performance increases slightly since we can also remove some shader code that was required to workaround lack of descriptor buffers.\r\n\r\n### New extension requirements\r\n\r\nTo support descriptor buffers in the code base, these features are now required instead of optional.\r\nNote that these features are widely supported already and is not expected to cause any problems.\r\nIf an implementation could support v2.7, it will support v2.8.\r\n\r\n- `VK_KHR_buffer_device_address`\r\n- `VK_KHR_push_descriptor`\r\n\r\n## Rewritten support for host accessible images\r\n\r\nThe entire API feature was rewritten from scratch to support more implementations and edge cases without\r\na lot of per-application hacks and workarounds.\r\nAs the most extreme example of weird API usage, Guardians of the Galaxy should (finally) run well on NVIDIA.\r\n\r\n## Rewritten swap chain\r\n\r\nTo most users, this change should be transparent.\r\n\r\n- Allow more precise control on latency and frame pacing with `VK_KHR_present_wait`.\r\n  - mesa-git supports this along with NVIDIA.\r\n  - `VKD3D_SWAPCHAIN_LATENCY_FRAMES=n` allows user to force a specific amount of latency.\r\n  - Implementation of DXGI latency fences is now correct.\r\n- Reduce CPU overhead on the main thread that presents to swap chain.\r\n- Fixes a spurious hang in Hitman III where game relies on asynchronous present in order to not lock up.\r\n- Win32 specific DXGI code is handled by DXVK. A DXVK build from Experimental or later is required for this to work.\r\n  This allows a native Linux implementation of vkd3d-proton, including swap chain.\r\n- When `VK_KHR_present_wait` is not supported, behavior should be 1:1 with old implementation.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The old swapchain implementation is still in the repository, and is expected to be removed in the next release.\r\nFor now, `VKD3D_CONFIG=swapchain_legacy` can be used to triage any potential issues with the new one.\r\n\r\nNOTE: A driver crash was observed on NVIDIA 525.x drivers when running in some PRIME configurations.\r\nFor now, we disable use of present_wait on these drivers.\r\n\r\n### Fixes and workarounds\r\n\r\n- Workaround GPU hangs in Spiderman Remastered: Miles Morales (same issue as the original).\r\n- Fix rendering bug with gun damage in Borderlands 3 on RADV.\r\n- Refactor how resizable BAR is used. GPUs with 4 GiB and lower will no longer attempt to use resizable BAR,\r\n  which can avoid some out-of-memory situations.\r\n- Fix GPU hang in Age of Empires IV.\r\n- Fix some minor issues in mesh shader implementation.\r\n- Fix some issues preventing RE: Village from booting on Arc.\r\n- Some last minute frenzied fixes for Witcher 3 next-gen update.\r\n  - All features except RT appears to work on RADV.\r\n  - Hairworks is known to crash GPU on NVIDIA. More investigation is needed to root cause.\r\n  - Some RT effects work on NVIDIA, others don't:\r\n    - GI is reported to work.\r\n    - AO crashes GPU. More investigation is needed to root cause.\r\n\r\n#### Implement minor missing D3D12 features\r\n\r\nAn obscure feature was stubbed out and forgotten until now.\r\n`ID3D12Device1::SetEventOnMultipleFenceCompletion()` is now implemented.\r\n\r\nAlso, implement SetEventOn(Multiple)FenceCompletion for shared D3D12 fences.\r\nFixes a regression in Gears 5 causing lockup on boot.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/86209974/reactions","total_count":86,"+1":31,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":16,"confused":0,"heart":23,"rocket":12,"eyes":3}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/81218285","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/81218285/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/81218285/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.7","id":81218285,"author":{"login":"HansKristian-Work","id":17786731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg2NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17786731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODH0hx84E10rt","tag_name":"v2.7","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version

release rolls up a massive amount of work since the Steam Deck launch in late February\r\nwith mostly features and fixes.\r\n\r\n### Heightened driver requirements\r\n\r\nNewer extensions are now required.\r\n\r\n- `VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering`\r\n- `VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state`\r\n- `VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state2` (no optional features required)\r\n- `VK_KHR_maintenance4`\r\n\r\n`KHR_dynamic_rendering` in particular requires Mesa 22.0 or NVIDIA 510 series, which should have\r\npropagated to distributions a long time ago at this point.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Proton 7.0 stable series will stick to v2.6 to avoid the hard driver requirement bump.\r\nProton Experimental and any future stable beyond 7.0 will stick to v2.7 and later.\r\n\r\n`KHR_dynamic_rendering` fixes many previously unsolvable issues, but it required a rewrite,\r\nand it was deemed impractical to support both legacy and modern paths.\r\n\r\n### Improved pipeline cache\r\n\r\nv2.6 introduced support for pipeline libraries, but only for games which made correct use of the D3D12 API.\r\nTo improve the situation across the board,\r\nvkd3d-proton now implements an internal \"magic\" disk cache to enable SPIR-V caching for all games.\r\nIt is possible to disable the magic cache and let applications manage the ID3D12PipelineLibrary itself if desired.\r\n\r\nTo further reduce on-disk footprint of the magic cache, we also make use of `VK_EXT_shader_module_identifier`\r\nto reduce the vkd3d-proton cache by >95%, since there is no need to store actual SPIR-V data on-disk.\r\n\r\n### Optimizations\r\n\r\nMostly a lot of minor things this release.\r\n\r\n- Slightly improve GPU performance for depth render passes.\r\n- Improve GPU performance for certain floating-point images where UAV usage was enabled.\r\n- Improve GPU performance for certain use cases of WriteBufferImmediate().\r\n- Improve GPU performance for certain access patterns of root descriptors.\r\n- Improve GPU performance for back-to-back buffer-image copies.\r\n- Improve GPU performance when allocating large zero-cleared resources and heaps.\r\n- Misc things here and there to reduce overhead.\r\n\r\n### New D3D12 features\r\n\r\n#### Mesh shaders\r\n\r\n`VK_EXT_mesh_shader` is required for this. Directly compatible with D3D12.\r\n\r\n#### Advanced ExecuteIndirect\r\n\r\nUses `VK_NV_device_generated_commands`. Supported by both RADV and NVIDIA. Allows Halo Infinite to run.\r\n\r\n#### DXR 1.1\r\n\r\nImplement some missing features from DXR 1.1:\r\n\r\n- AddToStateObject()\r\n- ExecuteIndirect trace rays\r\n- Various complex RTPSO features\r\n- DXIL subobject parsing\r\n- Misc query features\r\n\r\nWith these fixes in place, e.g. Cyberpunk 2077 DXR works. `VK_KHR_raytracing_maintenance1` is required for some features.\r\n\r\nNOTE: `VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr11` is required to enable DXR 1.1 for now.\r\n\r\n#### Shared resources\r\n\r\nBasic shared resources and fences are now supported when running on Proton. Allows interop with DXVK.\r\nSpecial thanks to Derek Lesho (@Guy1524) for implementation.\r\n\r\n#### SV_Barycentrics\r\n\r\nSM 6.1 barycentrics are now exposed through `VK_KHR_fragment_shader_barycentric`.\r\n\r\n#### Preliminary HDR support\r\n\r\nvkd3d-proton can take advantage of HDR now, assuming the system itself supports it.\r\n\r\n### Game fixes and workarounds\r\n\r\n- Fix random GPU hangs in Hitman 3.\r\n- Fix crash in Redout 2.\r\n- Fix random GPU hang in F1 2021.\r\n- Fix random flicker in Guardians of the Galaxy.\r\n- Update some API checks required by latest AgilitySDK runtime features.

has been a long while since 2.5, and this release rolls up a lot of fixes, features and optimizations.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix black screen rendering bug in Horizon Zero Dawn after latest game updates.\r\n- Fix crashes on startup in Final Fantasy VII: Remake and Warframe.\r\n- Fix crashes in Guardians of the Galaxy when interacting with certain game objects.\r\n- Fix hang on game shutdown in Elden Ring.\r\n- Fix broken geometry rendering in Age of Empires: IV.\r\n\r\n### Optimization\r\n\r\n- Improve generated shader code for vectorized load-store operations in DXIL.\r\n- Greatly reduce CPU overhead for descriptor copy operations,\r\n  which is a key contributor to CPU overhead in D3D12.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n#### Pipeline library rewrite\r\n\r\nSupport D3D12 pipeline libraries better where we can now also cache\r\ngenerated SPIR-V from DXBC/DXIL.\r\nMassively reduces subsequent load times in Monster Hunter: Rise,\r\nand helps other titles like Guardian of the Galaxy and Elden Ring.\r\nAlso lays the groundwork for internal driver caches down the line for games which do not use this API.\r\nAlso, deduplicates binary blobs for reduced disk size requirements.\r\n\r\n#### Shader models\r\n\r\nShader model 6.6 is now fully implemented. This includes support for:\r\n- ResourceDescriptorHeap[] direct access\r\n- 64-bit atomics\r\n- IsHelperLane()\r\n- Compute shader derivatives\r\n- WaveSize attribute\r\n- Packed math intrinsics\r\n\r\n#### Minor features\r\n\r\n- Handle API feature MinResourceLODClamp correctly if `VK_EXT_image_view_min_lod` is supported.\r\n- Expose CastFullyTypedFormat feature.\r\n- Expose some advanced shader features on Intel related to UAV formats (`VK_KHR_format_feature_flags2`).\r\n- Support COLOR -> STENCIL copies.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\n- Workaround DEATHLOOP not emitting synchronization commands correctly. Fixes menu flicker on RADV.\r\n- Workaround quirky API usage in Elden Ring. Removes many kinds of stutter and chug when traversing the scenery.\r\n- Workaround certain environments failing to create Vulkan device if some `VK_NVX_*` extensions are enabled.\r\n- Workaround glitched foliage rendering in Horizon Zero Dawn after latest game updates.\r\n- Workaround some questionable UE4 shaders causing glitched rendering on RADV.\r\n\r\n### Note on future Vulkan driver requirements\r\n\r\n2.6 is expected to be the last vkd3d-proton release before we require some newer Vulkan extensions.\r\n`VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering` and `VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state`\r\n(and likely `dynamic_state_2` as well) will be required.\r\n\r\n`VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering` in particular requires up-to-date drivers and the legacy render pass path\r\nwill be abandoned in favor of it. Supporting both paths at the same time is not practical.\r\nMoving to `VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering` allows us to fix some critical flaws with the legacy API\r\nwhich caused potential shader compilation stutters and extra CPU overhead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/61004173/reactions","total_count":71,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":5,"hooray":5,"confused":0,"heart":33,"rocket":13,"eyes":5}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/51551216","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/51551216/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/51551216/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.5","id":51551216,"author":{"login":"HansKristian-Work","id":17786731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg2NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17786731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODH0hx84DEpvw","tag_name":"v2.5","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version 2.5","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-10-18T15:31:03Z","published_at":"2021-10-18T15:37:40Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/assets/47273592","id":47273592,"node_id":"RA_kwDODH0hx84C0VZ4","name":"vkd3d-proton-2.5.tar.zst","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"HansKristian-Work","id":17786731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg2NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17786731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zstd","state":"uploaded","size":2109660,"download_count":24597,"created_at":"2021-10-18T15:37:33Z","updated_at":"2021-10-18T15:37:36Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/download/v2.5/vkd3d-proton-2.5.tar.zst"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/tarball/v2.5","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/zipball/v2.5","body":"This is a release with a little bit of everything!\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n#### DXR progress\r\n\r\nDXR has seen significant work in the background.\r\n\r\n- DXR 1.1 is now experimentally exposed. It can be enabled with `VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr11`.\r\n  Note that DXR 1.1 cannot be fully implemented in `VK_KHR_ray_tracing`'s current form, in particular\r\n  DispatchRays() indirect is not compatible yet,\r\n  although we have not observed a game which requires this API feature.\r\n- DXR 1.1 inline raytracing support is fully implemented.\r\n- DXR 1.0 support is more or less feature complete.\r\n  Some weird edge cases remain, but will likely not be implemented unless required by a game.\r\n  `VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr` will eventually be dropped when it matures.\r\n\r\nSome new DXR games are starting to come alive, especially with DXR 1.1 enabled,\r\nbut there are significant bugs as well that we currently cannot easily debug.\r\nSome experimental results on NVIDIA:\r\n\r\n- **Control** - already worked\r\n- **DEATHLOOP** - appears to work correctly\r\n- **Cyberpunk 2077** - DXR can be enabled, but GPU timeouts\r\n- **World of Warcraft** - according to a user, it works, but we have not confirmed ourselves\r\n- **Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition** -\r\n    gets ingame and appears to work? Not sure if it looks correct.\r\n    Heavy CPU stutter for some reason ...\r\n- **Metro Exodus** (original release) - GPU timeouts when enabling DXR\r\n- **Resident Evil: Village** - Appears to work, but the visual difference is subtle.\r\n\r\nIt's worth experimenting with these and others.\r\nDXR is incredibly complicated, so expect bugs.\r\nFrom here, DXR support is mostly a case of stamping out issues one by one.\r\n\r\n#### NVIDIA DLSS\r\n\r\nNVIDIA contributed integration APIs in vkd3d-proton which enables DLSS support in D3D12 titles in Proton.\r\nSee Proton documentation for how to enable NvAPI support.\r\n\r\n#### Shader models\r\n\r\nA fair bit of work went into DXIL translation support to catch up with native drivers.\r\n\r\n- Shader model 6.5 is exposed.\r\n  Shader model 6.6 should be straight forward once that becomes relevant.\r\n- Shader model 6.4 implementation takes advantage of `VK_KHR_shader_integer_dot_product` when supported.\r\n- Proper fallback for FP16 math on GPUs which do not expose native FP16 support (Polaris, Pascal).\r\n  Notably fixes AMD FSR shaders in Resident Evil: Village (and others).\r\n- Shader model 6.1 SV_Barycentric support implemented (NVIDIA only for now).\r\n- Support shader model 6.2 FP32 denorm control.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nResizable BAR can improve GPU performance about 10-15% in the best case, depends a lot on the game.\r\nHorizon Zero Dawn and Death Stranding in particular improve massively with this change.\r\n\r\nBy default, vkd3d-proton will now take advantage of PCI-e BAR memory types through heuristics\r\nas D3D12 does not expose direct support for resizable BAR, and native D3D12 drivers are known to use heuristics as well.\r\nWithout resizable BAR enabled in BIOS/vBIOS, we only get 256 MiB which can help performance,\r\nbut many games will improve performance even more\r\nwhen we are allowed to use more than that.\r\nThere is an upper limit for how much VRAM is dedicated to this purpose.\r\nWe also added `VKD3D_CONFIG=no_upload_hvv` to disable all uses of PCI-e BAR memory.\r\n\r\nOther performance improvements:\r\n\r\n- Avoid redundant descriptor update work in certain scenarios (NVIDIA contribution).\r\n- Minor tweaks here and there to reduce CPU overhead.\r\n\r\n### Fixes and workarounds\r\n\r\n- Fix behavior for swap chain presentation latency HANDLE. Fixes spurious deadlocks in some cases.\r\n- Fix many issues related to depth-stencil handling, which fixed various issues in DEATHLOOP, F1 2021, WRC 10.\r\n- Fix DIRT 5 rendering issues and crashes. Should be fully playable now.\r\n- Fix some Diablo II Resurrected rendering issues.\r\n- Workaround shader bugs in Psychonauts 2.\r\n- Workaround some Unreal Engine 4 shader bugs which multiple titles trigger.\r\n- Fix some stability issues when VRAM is exhausted on NVIDIA.\r\n- Fix CPU crash in boot-up sequence of Far Cry 6 (game is still kinda buggy though, but gets in-game).\r\n- Fix various bugs with host visible images. Fixes DEATHLOOP.\r\n- Fix various DXIL conversion bugs.\r\n- Add Invariant geometry workarounds for specific games which require it.\r\n- Fix how d3d12.dll exports symbols to be more in line with MSVC.\r\n- Fix some edge cases in bitfield instructions.\r\n- Work around extreme CPU memory bloat on the specific NVIDIA driver versions which had this bug.\r\n- Fix regression in Evil Genius 2: World Domination.\r\n- Fix crashes in Hitman 3.\r\n- Fix terrain rendering in Anno 1800.\r\n- Various correctness and crash fixes.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/51551216/reactions","total_count":94,"+1":34,"-1":0,"laugh":3,"hooray":30,"confused":0,"heart":23,"rocket":2,"eyes":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/45913564","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/45913564/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/45913564/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.4","id":45913564,"author":{"login":"HansKristian-Work","id":17786731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg2NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17786731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTQ1OTEzNTY0","tag_name":"v2.4","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version

release adds support for more D3D12 features and greatly improves GPU bound performance\r\nin many scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n#### Early DXR 1.0 support\r\n\r\n`VK_KHR_raytracing` is used to enable cross-vendor ray-tracing support.\r\nThe implementation is WIP, but it is good enough to run some real content.\r\n\r\nAs of writing, only the NVIDIA driver works correctly.\r\nIt is expected AMD RDNA2 GPUs will work when working drivers are available\r\n(amdgpu-pro 21.10 is known to not work).\r\n\r\nGames which are expected to work include:\r\n- Control (appears to be fully working)\r\n- Ghostrunner (seems to work, not exhaustively tested)\r\n\r\nTo enable DXR support, `VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr %command%` should be used when launching game.\r\nCertain games may be unstable if DXR is enabled by default.\r\n\r\n#### Conservative rasterization\r\n\r\nFull support (tier 3) for conservative rasterization was added.\r\n\r\n#### Variable rate shading\r\n\r\nFull support (tier 2) for variable rate shading was added.\r\n\r\n#### Command list bundles\r\n\r\nAllows Kingdom Hearts remaster to get past the errors, unsure if game fully works yet.\r\n\r\n#### Write Watch and APITrace\r\n\r\nSupport for `D3D12_HEAP_FLAG_ALLOW_WRITE_WATCH` has been added.\r\nThis means [APITraces](https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/apitrace/releases) of titles can now be captured.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\n- Improve GPU bound performance in RE2 by up to 20% on NVIDIA.\r\n- Enable async compute queues. Greatly improves GPU performance and frame pacing in many titles.\r\n  Horizon Zero Dawn and Death Stranding see exceptional gains with this fix,\r\n  due to how the engines work. GPU utilization should now reach ~100%.\r\n  For best results, AMD Navi+ GPUs are recommended, but Polaris and earlier still\r\n  see great results. It is possible to disable this path, if for whatever reason\r\n  multiple queues are causing issues. See README.\r\n- Optimize bindless constant buffer GPU-bound performance on NVIDIA if certain API code paths are used.\r\n- Optimize sparse binding CPU overhead.\r\n- `TRACE` logging calls are disabled by default on release builds.\r\n\r\n### Fixes and workarounds\r\n\r\n- Fix various DXIL bugs.\r\n- Be more robust against broken pipeline creation API calls.\r\n  Avoids driver crashes in Forza Horizon 4.\r\n- Workaround some buggy shaders in F1 2020.\r\n- Fix bugs if depth bounds test is used in certain ways.\r\n- Fix a read out-of-bounds in `UpdateTileMappings`.\r\n- Fix `SV_ClipDistance` and `SV_CullDistance` in Hull Shaders.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/38332586","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/38332586/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/38332586/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.2","id":38332586,"author":{"login":"HansKristian-Work","id":17786731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg2NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17786731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM4MzMyNTg2","tag_name":"v2.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version 2.2","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-02-19T19:45:04Z","published_at":"2021-02-19T19:48:13Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/assets/32324162","id":32324162,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDMyMzI0MTYy","name":"vkd3d-proton-2.2.tar.zst","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"HansKristian-Work","id":17786731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg2NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17786731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansKristian-Work/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zstd","state":"uploaded","size":1957015,"download_count":7017,"created_at":"2021-02-19T19:47:40Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T19:47:54Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/download/v2.2/vkd3d-proton-2.2.tar.zst"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/tarball/v2.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/zipball/v2.2","body":"This release is mostly a maintenance release which fixes bugs and regressions.\r\nIt also unblocks significant future feature development.\r\n\r\n### Workaround removals\r\n\r\n- Replace old `force_bindless_texel_buffer` workaround with\r\n  a more correct and performant implementation.\r\n  Death Stranding and Cyberpunk 2077 (and probably other games as well) do the right thing by default without the hack now.\r\n- Remove old workaround `disable_query_optimization` for occlusion queries which was enabled for AC: Valhalla,\r\n  and is now replaced by a correct and efficient implementation.\r\n\r\n#### Cyberpunk 2077 status\r\nFrom recent testing on our end, it is unknown at this time if `VK_VALVE_mutable_descriptor_type` is still required for\r\nCyberpunk 2077.

The Division (was working already in 2.0, but missing from list)\r\n - AC: Valhalla (*)\r\n\r\n(*): Game requires full D3D12 sparse texture support to work.\r\nCurrently only works on NVIDIA drivers.\r\nRADV status remains unknown until support for this feature lands in Mesa.\r\n\r\nNew games added to \"kinda works, but expect a lot of jank\" list:\r\n - Cyberpunk 2077 (**)\r\n\r\n(**): Currently only runs correctly on AMD hardware with RADV and `VK_VALVE_mutable_descriptor_type`.\r\nAs of game version 1.03, this requires the latest Mesa Git build.\r\nThe game has some fatal bugs where it relies on undefined behavior with descriptor management\r\nwhich this extension works around by accident.\r\nThe game will start and run on NVIDIA, but just like what happens without the extension on AMD,\r\nthe GPU will randomly hang, making the game effectively unplayable.\r\nA game update to fix this bug would likely make the game playable on NVIDIA as well.\r\nGame version 1.04 changed some behavior, and support for this game will likely fluctuate over time as future patches come in.\r\n\r\nBug fixes and workarounds:\r\n - Fix various implementation bugs which caused AC: Valhalla to not work.\r\n - Work around game bug in Death Stranding where accessing map could cause corrupt rendering.\r\n   (Several games appear to have the same kind of application bug.)\r\n - Fix corrupt textures in Horizon Zero Dawn benchmark.\r\n - Fix SM 6.0 wave-op detection for Horizon Zero Dawn and DIRT 5.\r\n - Work around GPU hangs in certain situations where games do not use D3D12 correctly,\r\n   but native D3D12 drivers just render wrong results rather than hang the system.\r\n - Fix invalid SPIR-V generated by FP64 code.\r\n - Fix crash with minimized windows in certain cases.\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\n - ~15% GPU-bound uplift in Ghostrunner. Might help UE4 titles in general.\r\n - Slightly improve GPU bound performance when fully GPU bound on both AMD and NVIDIA.\r\n - Slightly improve GPU bound performance on RADV in various titles.\r\n - Reduce multi-threaded CPU overhead for certain D3D12 API usage patterns.\r\n - Add support for `VK_VALVE_mutable_descriptor_type` which\r\n   improves CPU overhead, memory bloat, and avoids potential memory management thrashing on RADV.\r\n   Also avoids GPU hangs in certain situations where games misuse the D3D12 API.\r\n\r\nMisc:\r\n - Implement `DXGI_PRESENT_TEST`.\r\n - Fix log spam when `DXGI_PRESENT_ALLOW_TEARING` is used."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/33573389","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/33573389/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/33573389/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.0","id":33573389,"author":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTMzNTczMzg5","tag_name":"v2.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version 2.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2020-11-06T16:13:19Z","published_at":"2020-11-06T16:20:17Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/assets/28016231","id":28016231,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDI4MDE2MjMx","name":"vkd3d-proton-2.0.tar.zst","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zstd","state":"uploaded","size":1829881,"download_count":3166,"created_at":"2020-11-06T16:19:53Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T16:19:58Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/download/v2.0/vkd3d-proton-2.0.tar.zst"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/tarball/v2.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/zipball/v2.0","body":"This initial release supports D3D12 Feature Level 12.0 and Shader Model 6.0 (DXIL).\r\n\r\nGames expected to work include:\r\n- Control\r\n- Death Stranding\r\n- Devil May Cry 5\r\n- Ghostrunner\r\n- Horizon Zero Dawn\r\n- Metro Exodus\r\n- Monster Hunter World\r\n- Resident Evil 2 / 3\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the README for supported driver versions."}]
